## Description
This program implements various techniques for fingerprint matching in Python. It includes classes for minutiae-based matching, feature descriptor-based matching (using SIFT/SURF), and pretrained CNN model-based matching. Additionally, it provides evaluation methods for authentication and identification tasks.

## Usage
You can use this program by importing the required classes and methods into your Python scripts. However, this program will not run on its won since its dependent on a massive set of fingerprints and that's too large to upload to github.
